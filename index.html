    <p>
        Ohio State has a goal to achieve zero waste by 2025 by diverting 90% of waste away from landfills. In order to achieve this goal, the faculty, student body, and general public must be well educated on what can and can't be recycled. On this website, you
        can read about the rules of recycling and then play a fun game to test your knowledge. Good luck and Go Bucks!!
